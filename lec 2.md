the relational model
=======================

constrast to hierarchical model and network model, relation mode is simple for
- data structure, just table to represent data
- easy querying for relation model, though it is complex enough


introduction to the relational model
-----------------------

all data represent in relation database is relation

relation consists of relation schema and relation instance
- schema specifies the tables's name, the name of each field, and the domain of each field 
- instance is a table
> a domain is referred to a relation schema by the domain name, and sets of associated values


why domain constraints are so fundamental ?
- specify the correct relation instance

what goes around comes around
=======================

introduce data modeling ideas, the later proposals are resemblance to old model,
so, it is worthfull to learn old data model.
